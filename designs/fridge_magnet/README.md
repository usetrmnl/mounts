# TRMNL Mount - Fridge Magnet

for placement on magnetic surfaces, such as a kitchen fridge. may not work on smaller bar fridges or ice machines due to materials used in constructions.

### features

- easy removal from the mount for battery charging (entire mount can also be removed)
- recessed spots for up to 6x magnets (5/8" diameter - ex [N35 Neodymium](https://www.magnet4sale.com/neodymium-magnet-n35-dia-5-8x1-16-disc-magnet-rare-earth-magnets/))

in testing we found that only 3-4x magnets are required on flat surfaces. if a refrigerator door is curved, 6x magnets are recommended. if the magnetic surface is flat but some household members prefer to slam doors, 6x magnets are recommended.
